My solutions for http://adventofcode.com

The solutions are saves in folders per year. There is also a `utils` folder where I try to keep useful strings and arrays manipulation functions to share across exercises.

## Setup

```
$ npm install
```

## Run

```
$ npm run watch
```

This will compile, run and watch the `src/index.js` with nodemon and babel.
